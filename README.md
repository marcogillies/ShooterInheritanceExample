# ShooterInheritanceExample

A simple shooter game to teach inheritance

There are different versions from different lecture, each of which has its own branch. So please switch branches to get the version you are looking for. 

The branches are

### inheritanceLecture

This is the first version I showed in its own lecture

### exceptionsLecture

This is a slightly modified version that I showed in a lecture on expceptions (it catches an error when the gameOver game state is not what was expected)

### master 

contains the most up to date version (i.e. exceptionsLecture)
